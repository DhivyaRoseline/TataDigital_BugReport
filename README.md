#  Manual Bug Report – Tata Digital Website

This is a manual testing project created as part of my QA learning journey.  
I tested the public-facing website of Tata Digital and documented a few usability and functional issues. The report includes detailed descriptions, priorities, and screenshots for visual reference.
